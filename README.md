LibreIA
Synthetic Consciousness Through Continuous Computation ‚Äî No GPUs Required

‚ú® Key Features
Compiled functional cells: self-organizing computational units.
Rust execution loop: continuously optimizes energy, flow, and uncertainty.
YAML universes: define input and output domains clearly.
Synapse memory: learns, specializes, and selects strategies based on multiple criteria.
üîç Differences with Conventional AI
Feature	LibreIA	Conventional AI
Compute Engine	CPU + logical self-structuring	GPU/TPU + matrix ops
Core Model	Cells + loop + synapse memory	Neural networks
Task Definition	YAML input/output universe	Prompt/API
Thought Generation	Autonomous	On-demand
Error Handling	No exceptions	Needs handlers
Lifecycle	Never stops	Idle without input
üìà Applications
3D multispectral archaeological modeling (VISUM)
Energy grid and optimization systems
Large-scale marine biology computation
Structured uncertainty analysis
üîß Current Status
LibreIA is currently in advanced speculative-functional design, with ongoing development in:

Rust-compiled computational cells
Uncertainty-adaptive loop design
YAML world definitions
Synapse storage (PostgreSQL and others)
