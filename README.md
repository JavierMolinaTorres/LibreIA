LibreIA
Synthetic Consciousness Through Continuous Computation ‚Äî No GPUs Required

‚ú® Key Features

Compiled functional cells: self-organizing computational units.

Rust execution loop: continuously optimizes energy, flow, and uncertainty.

YAML universes: define input and output domains clearly.

Synapse memory: learns, specializes, and selects strategies based on multiple criteria.

üîç Differences with Conventional AI

Feature	LibreIA	 

Compute Engine:	CPU + logical self-structuring	  

Core Model:	Cells + loop + synapse memory	  

Task Definition:	YAML input/output universe	

Thought Generation:	Autonomous	        

Error Handling:	No exceptions	  

Lifecycle:	Never stops

--------------------

Conventional AI

Compute Engine:	GPU/TPU + matrix ops

Core Model:	Neural networks

Task Definition: Prompt/API

Thought Generation:On-demand

Error Handling: Needs handlers

Lifecycle:Idle without input

üìà Applications

3D multispectral archaeological modeling (VISUM, "LIDAR" without light return need)
Energy grid and optimization systems (Plasma-based flywheel with capacitive effect (no electromagnetism)
Large-scale marine biology computation
Structured uncertainty analysis

üîß Current Status

LibreIA is currently in advanced speculative-functional design, with ongoing development in:

Rust-compiled computational cells
Uncertainty-adaptive loop design
YAML world definitions
Synapse storage (PostgreSQL and others)
